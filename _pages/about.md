I joined University of Central Arkansas in 2021. I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering](https://uca.edu/physics/). Previously, I was a Sr. Research Associate in [IRAS Lab](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/intelligent-robotics-and-autonomous-systems-laboratory.html) at University of Cincinnati.
